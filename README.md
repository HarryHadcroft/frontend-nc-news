# Northcoders News Web Application
The intention of this project was to build the front-end of Northcoders News, a social news website and forum where content is curated and promoted by user-voting. Northcoders news displays multiple articles which can be filtered by topic, sorted by: date published, number of votes, number of comments and ordered by ascending and descending. Users can also add comments to the article they are viewing and like or dislike the article
